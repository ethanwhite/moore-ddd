# Fundamental Questions and Five-Year Impact

*What do you envision as the five-year impact of your work on one or more of the
natural sciences? Is there a key, fundamental question that you are trying to
answer? How will you measure progress towards answering this question over the
five years?*

## Impact

Ecologists typically justify their research based on the importance of
predicting how ecological systems and the services they provide will respond to
global change. However, only a tiny fraction of research in the field actually
attempts to make meaningful testable predictions. The little prediction that is
done typically focuses on a single area and a single taxonomic group meaning
that we do not know whether these predictions can be applied broadly. As a
result ecology is failing to make rapid progress as a field, because it lacks
meaningful bench marks for comparing and improving models and fails to develop
models that can be applied to understudied regions and taxa.

Now is the perfect time to lead ecology from a descriptive to a predictive
science. We know possess the abundance of data necessary to tackle prediction
(cite big data blog post?), the methods to develop predictive models from these
data (e.g., machine learning, hierarchical modeling), and the mathematical and
computational technology to develop and assess models from across the
data-driven to theory-driven spectrum. I will develop predictive models for
ecology across different levels of organization and ecosystems, and across the
diversity of life. I will develop tools to make data-intensive science easier,
and train the next generation of scientists in data-intensive approaches. In
combination, **the broad impact of my work will be to make ecology a more
predictive and data-intensive science that can both understand the processes
governing ecological systems and address the numerous challenges faced due to
anthropogenic change.**


## Fundamental Question

My research will focus on one of the most fundamental questions in ecology:
**What will ecological systems look like in the future?**

This question is fundamental to knowing how well we understand ecological
systems, because if we cannot predict how they will change we do not understand
how they operate. As such, answering this fundamental question will also require
understanding a second fundamental question. What governs the structure,
dynamics, and fluxes or ecological systems. This question is also fundamental to
the application of ecology in management and policy decisions. In order to
protect at risk species, conserve biodiversity, and maintain ecosystem services,
we need to be able to predict how they will respond to both stress like climate
change and land use change, and potential interventions such as the reserves and
the removal of invasive species.

Specifically I will focus on understanding and making forecasts for three major
areas of ecology: 1) the abundance of individual species; 2) the structure and
function of communities (groups of species in the same area); and 3) the
behavior of entire ecosystems in terms of fluxes and ecosystem services. I will
seek to capture how these different aspects of ecology change through time and
vary across ecosystems and the diversity of life.

Populations, communities, and ecosystems are three of the central levels of
organization in ecology. They are all amenable to data-intensive approaches due
to both large amounts of existing data (from thousands of individual studies,
citizen science projects, and coordinated government sampling) and due to a
massive influx of new data from a suite of ecological observatory
networks. Understanding and being able to predict these three aspects of ecology
will allow us to address a broad array of core ecological questions. We will be
able to predict where individual species are likely to occur and how their
abundances will change through time in response to shifts in climate, land-use
change, and invasive species. We will be able to predict how diversity and
rarity will respond to anthropogenic pressures across different spatial scales,
ecosystems, and taxonomic groups. We will be able to predict how ecosystem
fluxes and the services they provide will change over the next 50 years.

We will do this using a combination of data-driven and theory-driven approaches,
using large compilations of ecological data to guide the improvement of both
approaches and to determine the most promising routes forward. We will use far
more comprehensive and sophisticated data compilations than have been brought to
bear on these questions before including data on 100s of millions of species
occurrence records, high temporal resolution climate and land use data (rather
than long-term averages), and newly available text-mining and compilation based
datasets on large numbers of species traits and species interactions.

## Measuring Progress

Due to my focus on the measure of our success will be in how effectively we can
predict independent data, and ultimately in how well we can predict the future
state of ecological systems. Beyond the specific research that my group conducts
a fuller measure of our success will be measured by how our work influences
ecology more broadly to focus on prediction, data-intensive approaches, and
strong tests of theory.

We will measure the progress of our research at three levels:
1. How well we can predict the state of ecological systems in different
   locations. This serves as a pre-requisite for understanding temporal dynamics
   by helping us develop effective modeling strategies.
2. Forecasting and hindcasting within existing time-series at different lags by
   training models only on data from either the beginning or end of the
   time-series.
3. The ultimate measure of progress will be to actually make forecasts for data
   where we know that new data will be collected in following years. Each year we will
   make predictions for the state of ecological systems 1-5, 10, and 50 years
   from present and evaluate those predictions as the new data is collected. We
   will do this both using measured data on the (non-ecological) state of the
   system in the evaluation year (to test our ability to make predictions to
   planned or otherwise know changes) and using only information available at
   the time of the pre-evaluation sampling, such as predictions about
   weather/climate and landuse for the following year(s). 

Measuring ones ability to refocus the efforts of a field is more challenging. I
will simultaneously advocate for a greater emphasis on predictive,
data-intensive, approaches in ecology and measure my ability to do so by running
a series of "prediction challenges" (similar to kaggle competitions with a focus
on ecological forecasting). My influence on the field will be measured based on
the response to these challenges in two ways. First, the level of participation
through time will provide an indication of how interesting and popular these
approaches are to ecologists. Second, the collective performance of the
competitors will provide a measure of how successful we are being as a field in
addressing the big questions and developing the training and human capital
necessary to address the broad array of questions utilizing the large amount of
data in ecology.


# Advancing Data Science [Methodologies]

*How will you advance data science methodologies, such as statistics, machine
learning, automated inference, etc., to achieve this goal? We are particularly
interested in the ways that the data science methodologies that you propose to
develop can be applied to other fields beyond the one you focus on and
shared. Please discuss these plans. What work products do you plan to make open
source?*

* Bringing data science approaches to the masses (major focus)
  * Bring the data to the scientists in the form they need to analyze
  * Variety aspect of big data
  * Machine learning on high-dimensional problems
  * Training the next generation of data-intensive scientists
  * Changing scientists and how they interact with data

The primary limit to the progress of data science at the moment is human
capital. There is too much data and too many important problems to be addressed
by the small number of individuals with the combination of computational and
analytic skills to work with large amounts of heterogeneous data. To address
this issue my group will continue to pursue a three-pronged approach.

1. Training scientists in the skills and ways of thinking of data science, and
   doing so in collaborative ways that influence science broadly.
2. Building tools that automatically handle acquiring, cleaning up, and
   combining heterogeneous data sources, removing impediments to data intensive
   approaches and allowing scientists to focus on the science side of data
   science.
3. Developing approaches for dealing with complex high-dimensional data. 

This allows scientists to spend more time focusing on the science and less time
wrestling with data, and makes it easier for a broader array of scientists to
engage in data-intensive approaches.

### Tools

In order to address these questions we will use machine learning, strong tests
of theory... Ecological systems are inherently high dimensional,
multi-level/scale... Therefore we will use X... Combining numerous heterogeneous
datasets.

We will build tools and develop training to allow other scientists to take
advantage of these approaches.

#### BlendDat

A lot of data-intensive work requires combining heterogeneous data from a number
of disparate sources. In ecology this often involves combining ecological data,
spatiotemporal environmental data, species level data on organismal traits, and
information about the evolutionary history of the organisms involved. There are
analogs from across the data science spectrum. Currently there is no effective way to
generalize these problems and collaborate on developing common combinations of
datasets. Building on my experiences from developing the EcoData Retriever I
will lead the development of a general tool for automatically combining multiple
heterogenous datasets into a 
datasets into a 
    * integrate with dat streams
	* blend using approximation based on available data + models to fill in gaps
      (e.g., species traits based on phylogeny, physiological rates based on
      body size)

* Imperfect data
    * developing methods for using imperfect data building on Silver, Gelman,
      etc.
	* detection
	* missing data (e.g., traits, physiology, etc.)
	    * leveraging what we do know to estimate what we don't
		* combine mass + phylogeny in models
	* Combining big (volume/velocity) high quality data with big (variety) lower
      quality data by modeling the relationships between them.

* Wrappers for tools developed in collaboration with rOpenSci


  
The Retriever already accomplishes the goals of new projects such as dat,
albeit in a more domain specific context. Talked with dat team about making our
tools talk together in part through moving the Retriever to the same metadata
standard being developed for dat.
  


* High-dimensional prediction
    * Ecology represents an extreme point on the high dimensional axis and this
      work will help break ground in that area
    * species interactions (Clark et al. 2014, Harris 2014)
	* interactions are context dependent (see Chamberlain et al. 2014 Ecology
      Letters)

* Spatial challenges
    * development of new form of cross-validation (McGill & Bahn 201X, Harris 2014)

### Training

* Human capital
    * One of the most crucial areas for development in data science is human
      capital. There is too much data and too many important problems to be
      addressed by the small number of individuals with the combination of
      computational and analytic skills to work with large amounts of
      heterogeneous data. In addition, in many fields we lack individuals who
      are capable of thinking properly about how to understand the world using
      existing data as opposed to experiments. To overcome these limitations we
      need to train scientists at all levels in the tools and approaches needed
      for tackling data-intensive problems. This extends from scientists working
      only with the data they personally collect (because it is now possible for
      a single individual to collect far more data than most scientists know how
      to work with), to those wanting to combine data they collected with
      existing datasets to leverage others efforts to expand the scope of what
      they can accomplish, to folks that want to focus on large integrated
      analyses of multiple datasets to understand life, the universe, and
      everything.
	* The problem with most scientific training initiatives is that they are
      isolated enterprises funded for a brief period of time by a single
      grant. As a result they do not benefit from the collaborative experience
      of large numbers of educators and they fail to build the momentum,
      reputation, and communities, that would allow them to have the broadest
      impact. To avoid these issues in the education component of my current
      National Science Foundation CAREER award I have teamed up with Software
      Carpentry and the Mozilla Science Lab to put our resources to work as part
      of a broader collaboration.
    * I have helped run seven Software Carpentry workshops in the past two
      years, produced video lectures,
	* Software Carpentry
	* Data Carpentry
	    * While data science skills have a lot of overlap with software
          development skills, there are also large aspects of data science
          approaches that are not covered in the current Software Carpentry
          curriculum. To begin to address this limitation in the training of the
          next generation of data-intensive scientists I am part of a small
          group leading the development of a proof-of-concept for a new Data
          Carpentry curriculum that focuses on tools and approaches related to
          data. In collaboration with scientists from an array of NSF funded
          centers with data-intensive components I have been discussing a first
          draft of a beginner curriculum and we have just finished

   	* A new generation of data-intensive scientists from those analyzing data
      they collected themselves to those integrated large diverse datasets to
      answers questions at scale

* on-boarding scientists into open source collaboration
* attract non-scientists to participate in these collaborations

## Bone yard

* the answers to be extrapolated across scales, ecosystems, and the diversity of life:
* A more predictive ecology/biology

What will pops, comms, and ecosystems look like in 20 years?
What will ecological systems look like in 20 years...

...from populations to communities to ecosystems.

    * What are the most important processes for structuring ecological
	  communities from populations to ecosystems?
	* What will these systems look like in 10, 50, 100 years?
	* "Data-intensive approaches to predicting/forecasting the distributions &
      abundances of species
	* ID regions for conservation where most species will be in 50 years
	* By combining data-driven and theory-driven approaches in a data-intensive
      context

* Use short term climate data rather than long-term averages
    * more complex and high dimensional, but actually linked to process

More importantly than the work the my group accomplishes, the full measure of
our success will be determined by whether or not our work and advocacy yields a
general shift in ecology more broadly that shows that our research and outreach
efforts have pushed ecologists toward expecting: 1. strong tests of theory that
focus on both the underlying process and whether or not it has a strong
influence on the ecological outcome, 2. acceptance of data-driven approaches,
and 3. an emphasis on empirical prediction as the arbiter/goal for both
theory-driven and data-driven approaches.

[could go in either to some degree] The two foci in the preproposal represent
data-driven vs. theory-driven approaches with both in a data-intensive
context. My work will lead in the combination of these two approaches to produce
a predictive understanding of ecology.


* prediction challenge (like kaggle competitions)
    * tech connections to encourage participation from outside ecology 
    * Despite this clear need for predictive ecology Nature recently suggested
      that ecology should abandon predictive approaches


* The broad impact of my work will be to make ecology and biology more
      generally a more predictive science that .
    * The editors of Nature may think that
      [ecologists should ignore prediction](http://www.nature.com/news/an-elegant-chaos-1.14849),
      but this is not a productive way forward.

	* A cross-system/taxon approach to ecology where either all ecosystems or
      all taxonomic groups or both are analyzed simultaneously to provide
      answers to questions the first time they are asked.
	* A new generation of data-intensive scientists from those analyzing data
      they collected themselves to those integrated large diverse datasets to
      answers questions at scale
