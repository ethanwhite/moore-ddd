## Synergistic Activities

**Ecoinformatics:** 1. Founder of EcologicalData.org – a website designed to use social media tools to allow ecologists to collaborate on the discovery and utilization of available ecological datasets. 2. EcoData Retriever – Leader of open source software development to automate the process of designing and configuring database structures for ecological databases as well as downloading, cleaning up and installing the data for the end user (http://ecodataretriever.org).

**Computational science education:** 1. Teacher of two Utah State University courses on introductory and advanced computer programming and database management for biologists. 2. Developer of a website for providing information about computational approaches in biology (http://programmingforbiologists.org). 3. Software Carpentry Advisory Board member, instructor,  and lead developer of new intermediate level material (http://software-carpentry.org), helping lead a group dedicated to providing online and in-person training to improve the use of advanced computational tools by scientists.

**Database development and education:** 1. data paper. 2. 

**Database development and provision:** 1. Team leader for the development of the Mammalian Community Database – an effort to assemble and publish global scale information on the composition of mammalian communities. This database is published in Ecological Archives (Thibault et al. 2011). 2. Lead database expert on the team that manages the databases for the Portal Project, an important time-series in ecology. The project includes four major datasets (mammals, plants, ants, and weather) that differ substantially in form and complexity. This team transitioned the databases from Microsoft Excel flat files to a relational database running in Microsoft Access in 2004 and transitioned them again in 2010 to a more stable and secure MySQL database that is available to all participants in the project via a secure Linux server.

**Open science:** 1. Social media 2. Preprint paper 3. Open proposals 4. Open software development. 5. Mozilla Science Lab
