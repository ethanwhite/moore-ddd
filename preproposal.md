## Background

Ecology needs data-intensive approaches to predict the responses of biodiversity
and ecosystem function to global change, address invasive species, and
prioritize areas for conservation. However, the challenges common in many areas
of data science are often magnified in ecology. These include highly
heterogeneous data across systems and studies, an unprecedented volume and
velocity of data that is now being collected using sensor networks and remote
sensing, and the lack of ecologists with the necessary training to deal with
this magnitude of data. Despite a clear need, the discipline has failed to
embrace data-intensive approaches (see e.g.,
[Paine 2010](http://doi.org/10.1086/656273),
[Lindenmayer & Likens 2011](http://doi.org/10.1890/0012-9623-92.3.245),
[2013](http://doi.org/10.1890/0012-9623-94.4.338)). Ecology needs leaders in
data science to: 1) demonstrate the value of data-intensive approaches in
ecology; 2) mine, assemble, and model existing data; 3) integrate existing data
with the large amounts of data now being generated by automated data collection
and citizen science; and 4) train ecologists in the tools and approaches
necessary for data-intensive science.


## Major Accomplishments

I entered graduate school with a field ecology background, but became frustrated
with the scope of inference that could be accomplished using typical ecological
approaches. It was possible to understand a single system well, but these
results could not be generalized across the globe and across the diversity of
life. I joined one of the only labs doing data-intensive ecology and have spent
my career using large data compilations to understand ecological systems at
continental to global scales, developing tools to make it faster and easier to
conduct this type of research, and training the next generation of
data-intensive ecologists.

**Research:** My research uses large data compilations to understand the
processes driving ecosystems, test ecological models, and make predictions
regarding ecological systems. We have developed novel approaches to
understanding patterns of biodiversity based on dividing species into resident
and transient species using the structure of their population time-series
([White & Hurlbert 2010](http://doi.org/10.1086/649578),
[Coyle et al. 2013](http://doi.org/10.1086/669903)). We have led the way in
strong general tests of ecological theory by creating the largest combined
datasets ever used in community ecology and using them to evaluate and compare
ecological theories
([White et al. 2006](http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1367&context=biology_facpub),
[Thibault et al. 2011](http://doi.org/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2010.00576.x),
[White et al. 2012](http://doi.org/10.1890/11-2177.1),
[Locey & White 2013](http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1735&context=biology_facpub),
[McGlinn et al. 2013](http://doi.org/10.7717/peerj.212),
[Xiao et al. 2013](http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0731)). Finally, we have built on
these ecological theories by using them to make predictions for biodiversity,
rarity, and patterns related to ecosystem level fluxes
([White et al. 2012](http://doi.org/10.1890/11-2177.1),
[Xiao et al. 2013](http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0731)). We are beginning to combine
this with new work using machine learning and remotely sensed data in
multi-level models to forecast the future state of ecological systems and make
predictions for unsurveyed locations.

**Software Development:** Conducting this type of research requires the
time-consuming assembly of numerous heterogeneous datasets. Typically every
scientist writes custom code to handle the data or assembles them by hand. This
wastes time and effort organizing data that could be spent doing science. My
group built the [EcoData Retriever](http://ecodataretriever.org) to address this
problem. It automates the discovery, downloading, cleaning, and reformatting of
ecological data. This simplifies the process of finding, acquiring, and using
data and therefore increases the use of the diversity of ecological
datasets. Altmetrics show that the Retriever is both
[highly recommended and highly cited](http://impactstory.org/ethanwhite/product/37058b0ebf0a11e1bdf912313d1a5e63)
(stars and forks on GitHub in the 91-99%tile), the associated paper is in the
[98th percentile of online impact for scientific papers](http://www.altmetric.com/details.php?citation_id=1555657),
and the installers were downloaded over 230 times in the last two weeks.

**Training & Mentoring:** I actively train and mentor the next generation of
data-intensive biologists. Using an NSF CAREER Award I have developed a
[suite of university courses](http://compb.io) that teach core aspects of data
science to biologists (programming, databases, statistics,
visualization). Course material is available online and has been viewed over
125,000 times by users in over 150 countries. Students and postdocs in my lab
with backgrounds including field biology, mathematics, statistics, and computer
science receive in-depth training in data-intensive approaches to ecology. I am
also actively involved in [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org):
developing material, teaching ecology focused workshops (6 in the last 2 years),
and serving on the advisory board. Finally, I have taken a leadership role in
making biology more open, reproducible, and data-intensive by: 1) openly sharing
[reproducible code](https://github.com/weecology),
[data](http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E092/201/default.htm), and
[grant proposals](http://figshare.com/authors/Ethan%20P.%20White/97015); 2)
writing papers on
[data management and sharing](http://doi.org/10.4033/iee.2013.6b.6.f),
[best practices in computational science](http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001745),
and
[the need for preprints in biology](http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001563);
and 3) explaining the importance of these approaches on my
[blog](http://jabberwockyecology.org) and through my active presence on
[Twitter](https://twitter.com/ethanwhite).


## Future Research Directions

My future research directions involve working in three key areas that will
create a foundation for data-intensive ecology: 1) tying data and
theory together more tightly by expanding the use of data-driven modeling in
ecology (e.g., machine learning, hierarchical modeling); 2) leveraging existing
data to test, improve, and make predictions using process based models; and 3)
developing tools and personnel to help scientists handle the challenges of
ecological data.

My data-driven modeling efforts have so far focused on entropy maximization
models, which predict the state of a system based on a set of empirical
constraints. We will build on this foundation by expanding more generally into
machine learning and hierarchical modeling to make predictions for ecological
patterns and processes across scales. We will develop a suite of master models
to address core questions about biodiversity, population dynamics, and ecosystem
processes, including biosphere influences on carbon fluxes and global
change. Specifically, we will develop models for the distribution of individuals
of species across the globe, the traits of those individuals, and the dynamics
of both counts and traits over time. These models will use large compilations of
climate, land use, and ecological data as predictors, including data on the
abundances of other species and their potential interactions both within and
across taxonomic groups (e.g., birds compete with other birds for food and
require plants for food and nesting). These models will be trained and tested
using compilations of ecological data from across ecosystems and taxonomic
groups, including an expanded version of our current compilation (which
currently includes data on the distribution of ~50 million individual
organisms), text mining data on interactions among species, and growing
compilations of individual level trait data (~2.5 million trait values).

I will leverage the large amounts of data currently being generated in ecology
to provide improved testing of process based ecological theories. We will
conduct strong tests and comparisons of population, community, and ecosystem
level models by evaluating their performance across ecosystems and taxonomic
groups, testing all of their predictions simultaneously using independent data,
and directly comparing predictions of different models for the same
patterns. Specifically, we will focus on models relating population dynamics to
environmental drivers, unified community theories making predictions for large
numbers of ecological patterns, and ecosystem models that relate properties of
the organisms at a site to the system level fluxes.  The information from these
comparisons will be used to identify the most promising models for making broad
scale ecological predictions, to identify aspects of these models that require
improvement, and to change or constrain these models to yield improved
predictions for ecological systems.

To help ecologists handle the challenges of data-intensive science I will
continue to expand my efforts to make data-intensive ecology easier, more
robust, and more reproducible. I plan to add provenance tracking and automated
reproducibilty features to the EcoData Retriever that will allow data processing
steps to be documented and easily reproduced. I will develop new tools to make
it easier to combine ecological, environmental, taxonomic, and other datasets in
reproducible ways to allow ecologists to quickly make use of the broad array of
data that relates to ecological systems. To address the lack of training for
scientists in data-intensive approaches I will participate in the development of
a new set of Data Carpentry material that builds on Software Carpentry's
knowledge and successes to train the next generation of scientists. In
combination, this research, tool building, and training will help establish a
data-intensive era for ecology.
